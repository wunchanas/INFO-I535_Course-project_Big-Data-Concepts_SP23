## Background 
World Health Organization (WHO) reported that air pollution causes about 7 million deaths annually (Babatola, 2018). In addition, exposure to air pollution has several short-term and long-term health effects. Short-term health effects include cough, asthma, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), while Long-term health effects are chronic asthma, cardiovascular diseases, and lung cancer (Manisalidis, Stavropoulou, Stavropoulos, & Bezirtzoglou, 2020). Therefore, monitoring the air quality is essential for protecting public health. The Air Quality Index (AQI) is a useful air quality indicator ranging from 0 to 500. For good air quality, the AQI is 50 or less, whereas the harmful air quality, the index exceeds 300 (https://www.airnowgov/aqi/aqi-basics/). Furthermore, understanding the insight of AQI data using data analysis and visualization is essential for making short- and long-term policy decisions to protect public health. 

Therefore, this present course project aimed to analyze and visualize an air pollution dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hasibalmuzdadid/global-air-pollution-dataset). The datasets were preprocessed, analyzed, and visualized into five interactive visualization types: Horizontal bar graph, Pie chart, TreeMap, Stacked bar chart, and Correlogram.

To gain insight on 
1. The average AQI, carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and particulate matter (PM2.5) values in each country in the world.
2. The worldwide distribution of air quality categories ('Good', 'Moderate', 'Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups', 'Unhealthy', 'Very Unhealthy', and 'Hazardous'). 
3. The key air pollutants that significantly affect AQI values.  

The knowledge and skills gained from "Management, Access, and Use of Big and Complex Data" topics, such as Cloud Computing, Virtualization, Lifecycles and Pipelines, were used to achieve course project objectives. 
I hope the information from this course project will provide valuable insights into a better understanding of air pollution, improving policies and strategies for air pollution management, and protecting public health.

#### About dataset
The dataset contains air pollution data from different cities in countries around the world. The air pollution data includes Air Quality Index (AQI) values, carbon monoxide (CO) values, ozone (O3) values, nitrogen dioxide (NO2) values, and particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5). The air quality is categorized into six categories, including 'Good', 'Moderate', 'Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups', 'Unhealthy', 'Very Unhealthy', and 'Hazardous' based on overall AQI values.
